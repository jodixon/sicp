#The Elements of Programming

A programming language serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about process.
Every language should have three mechanisms for combining simple ideas to form more complex ones:

* **Primitive Expressions** - the simplest entities the language is concerned with
* **Means of Combination** - by which compound elements are built from simpler ones
* **Means of Abstraction* - by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units

In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. Data is the "stuff" we
want to manipulate, and procedures are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data.
